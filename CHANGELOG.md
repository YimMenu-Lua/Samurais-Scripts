### v1.5.1 Changelog

#### Features

#### Self

ðŸŽ‰ **New Feature: Allow Hats In Vehicles:**

- Prevents the game from removing your hat or headgear/accessories when you enter a vehicle.

ðŸŽ‰ **New Feature: Don't Fall Off Vehicles:**

- Allows you to stand on top of vehicles without falling off when the vehicle moves.

**Improvement: Actions -> Movement Options:**

- Added a new movement style: **Zombie:**
  - Has idle/walking/running/sprinting anims.

#### Vehicle

ðŸŽ‰ **New Feature: Vehicle door lock control:**

- Has 2 main options and one complementary option:
  - Simple button to lock and unlock your vehicle.
  - Automatic Mode: Automatically locks your vehicle when you move away from it and unlocks it when you try to enter it again.
  - Auto-Raise Roof: Choose whether locking your vehicle also raises the convertible roof *(if, of course, your vehicle is a convertible)*.

  > **Note:** The feature only works on cars and trucks.
  > **Note:** If you lock a vehicle (or it gets automatically locked) then switch to a different vehicle, the previous one will be automatically unlocked.

#### Hotfix

- Fixed **Disable Action Mode** for good. I'm a lazy person and I didn't wanna do some research. It's properly implemented now instead of the previous broken hacky way of doing it.
- Removed the stupid player tab *(it was very likely the cause of #27)*.
