### v1.5.0 Changelog

#### Features

**Self -> Actions:**

- Reworked **Movement Options:**
  - The feature now has 2 modes: A drop-down list of custom movement options and an option to browse all movement clipsets from a json file.
  - Increased the number of custom movements from 6 to 32.
  - To use the json option, you first need to download the file from [this link](https://github.com/DurtyFree/gta-v-data-dumps/blob/master/movementClipsetsCompact.json) then place it in `%AppData%\YimMenu\scripts_config`.

**Business Manager:**

- Fixed MC businesses being in different orders for different users, which in turn broke all related features.
- Improved **CEO Warehouses:** Users no longer have to manually set how many warehouses they own and their sizes. The script will automatically grab the necessary information.
- Improved **Auto-Sell:** Added support for Acid Lab and Hangar **land** sales.
