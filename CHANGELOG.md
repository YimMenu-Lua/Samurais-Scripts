### v1.4.5 Changelog

#### Weapon

- Changed **Laser Sight** back to its original code from the alpha version of the script.
- Added a hotkey for the laser *(default **[L]** on keyboard)*.

#### Online

- Rworked the **Players** tab with a better UI and a few test options. Not sure why I did that but it kinda looks clean? Also added an option to spawn a pervert that will *(try to)* follow players and jerk off near them. *Pretend you didn't read that*.
