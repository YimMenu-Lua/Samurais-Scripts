### v1.3.9 Changelog

#### Ride With NPCs

- Improved the function to make all passengers chill, not just the driver. Now you can carpool in a vehicle with more than 1 NPC inside and none of them will be scared.

#### Hide & Seek

- Require the vehicle to be completely stopped **only if the player is driving**. If the player is a passenger, allow them to use the **hide in car** option as long as they're not seen by the cops. With this change, if you have a wanted level you can hide inside other players' or NPC vehicles.

#### Translations

- Fixed more broken translations.

#### MISC

- Removed more concatenated strings inside loops.
- Removed unused XML parser (it wasn't working anyway).
- Removed useless MPx global (character index).
- Fixed a typo that caused a crash when playing actions from the **Favorites** tab.
