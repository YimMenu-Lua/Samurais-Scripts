### v1.4.8 Changelog

#### World

🎉 **New Feature: Ambient Scenarios:**

- Allows you to play ambient scenarios that are scattered around in the open world, just like NPCs. These scenarios include taking photos, drinkig, smoking, working out, sitting on benches, chairs, sun loungers, laying down on a towel at the beach, etc...

- These ambient scenarios have exact points on the map where they can be triggered. Once you are in the vicinity of one, a prompt will show up on your screen asking you to press **[E]** to play the scenario.

> **NOTE:** Because it makes no sense to mark all of them, I'll leave them to your exploration sense to find them.

> **NOTE:** Due to a few scenarios being in very close proximity to each other, the prompt to play them can become annoying. For this, I've added an option to disable the prompt (but you'll never know when you're near an ambient scenario). Also, this causes another minor issue where you'll sometimes play a different scenario than the one shown in the prompt.

> **NOTE:** Some ambient scenarios are programmed for NPCs to spawn directly onto them, so playing them normally will most likely result in your ped bein in an awkward position *(example: sitting in the air)* or even fail to fully play. For this, I've added an option to **force** play or stop an ambient scenario by pressing **[Left Shift]** + **[E]**.

#### Online -> Business Manager

- Added instant sales for Air cargo, bunker, CEO warehouses and biker businesses with an option for auto-sales. This is an absolutely horrible feature but people like instant sales so 🤷‍♂️

#### MISC

- Added v1.70 DLC vehicles.
- Fixed a translation typo.
- Fixed an issue where the autofill options for the hangar and CEO warehouses weren't deactivating when the supplies reached the max.
- Updated YimConfig. Saved settings should be human-readable now.
