### v1.3.8 Changelog

**Translations:**

- **DEVS ONLY:** Added a Python script that automatically adds new translations in bulk. Either manually install the requirements using pip or uncomment the first 10 lines. Once all requirements are met, run the script and enter your desired language code. The script will translate all text then update the Lua translations file.
- Added 5 new languages:
  - Chinese (traditional)
  - Chinese (Simplified)
  - Japanese
  - Polish
  - Spanish
- Fixed some broken translations.
