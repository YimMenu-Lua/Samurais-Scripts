# Samurais-Scripts
A base for a Lua script written for [YimMenu](https://github.com/YimMenu/YimMenu) and centered around roleplaying and having fun in a game full of ad bots and toxic cheaters.

> [!NOTE]
> For now, only a handful of features are present. More will be added in the future.

## Contributing To Translations
#### Editing a pre-existing language:
1. Fork the repo then open `/lib/Translations.lua`
2. Find each entry for the language you want to modify/correct and edit the `text = ` field.
   
   **Example:**
     ```lua
     ["Self"] = {
        {iso = "fr-FR", text = "Traduction du mot 'Self' en Fran√ßais."},
     },
     ```
3. Open a PR.
#### Adding a new language:
1. Follow the same structure by adding a new table under each field containing your language's iso code and the translated text. So let's suppose you want to add Portuguese support:

   **Example:**
     ```lua
     ["Self"] = {
       {iso = "fr-FR", text = "Traduction du mot 'Self' en Fran√ßais."},
     -- leave the other tables as they are and add yours below the last one:
       {iso = "pt-BR", text = "Tradu√ß√£o da palavra 'Self' em Portugu√™s."},
     },
     ```
2. Open a PR. Your language will be added to the main script's language list under '**Settings**' if it doesn't already exist. Alternatively you can add it yourself by editing the `lang_T` table and following the same structure.

## Contributing To The Main Script
